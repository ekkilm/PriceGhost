## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **AI Model Selector** - Choose your preferred AI model in settings
  - Anthropic: Claude Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5
  - OpenAI: GPT-4.1 Nano, Mini, and Full
  - Ollama: Any locally installed model
- **Per-Product AI Controls** - Disable AI extraction and/or verification on individual products
  - Useful for products where AI interferes with manual price selection
  - Separate toggles for extraction (fallback) and verification
- **Gotify Notification Support** - Self-hosted push notifications via Gotify
  - Test connection before saving to verify server URL and app token
  - Full notification support for price drops, target prices, and stock changes
- **AI Stock Status Verification** - Separate AI call to verify stock status for variant products
  - When tracking a specific variant price, AI now verifies if that exact variant is in stock
  - Fixes false "in stock" status when other variants are available but tracked variant is not
- **Pause/Resume Checking** - Temporarily pause price checking on individual products or in bulk
  - Pause and Resume actions in the bulk Actions menu
  - Filter dropdown to show All / Active / Paused products
  - Paused products are greyed out with pause icon indicator
  - Scheduler automatically skips paused products

### Fixed

- **Ollama Thinking Mode** - Fixed Qwen3 and DeepSeek models outputting `<think>` tags instead of JSON
  - Added `/nothink` message before prompts to disable thinking mode
  - Added `num_ctx: 16384` for proper context window (was truncating HTML at 4K)
  - Added fallback to strip `<think>` tags from responses
- **AI Stock Status "Unknown"** - AI now correctly returns "out_of_stock" for pre-order/coming soon products
  - Previously returned "unknown" even when reasoning stated product was unavailable
  - Prompt now explicitly requires "out_of_stock" when product cannot be purchased

### Changed

- **Recommended AI Models** - Based on testing:
  - **Cloud**: Claude Haiku 4.5 (best accuracy for the cost)
  - **Local/Free**: Qwen3 (any size, with thinking mode disabled)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Multi-Strategy Price Voting System** - More robust price extraction using multiple methods
  - Runs all extraction methods (JSON-LD, site-specific, generic CSS, AI) in parallel
  - Uses consensus voting to select the correct price when methods agree
  - AI arbitration when extraction methods disagree
  - User price selection dialog when price is ambiguous (multiple prices found)
  - Remembers the winning extraction method for future checks of the same product
- **Price Selection Modal** - When multiple prices are found for a product, users can now select the correct one
  - Shows all price candidates with confidence levels
  - Displays extraction method and context for each candidate
  - Sorted by confidence (highest first)

### Changed

- **Improved scheduler** - Now uses preferred extraction method when available for faster, more accurate re-checks

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Notification History** - Complete log of all triggered notifications accessible via bell icon in navbar
  - Bell icon with badge showing recent notification count (last 24 hours)
  - Dropdown preview showing 5 most recent notifications
  - Full history page at `/notifications` with filtering by type
  - Tracks price drops, target price alerts, and back-in-stock notifications
  - Shows which channels (Telegram, Discord, Pushover, ntfy) received each notification
  - Links to product detail pages from notification entries
  - **Clear button** to dismiss notifications from dropdown without deleting history
- **Particle background effect** - Subtle animated particles floating behind all content
  - Theme-aware: white particles on dark mode, indigo on light mode
  - Multiple layers with varying speeds for depth effect
- **Star History chart** in README to track repository stars over time

### Fixed

- **Notification crash with string prices** - Fixed TypeError when notification prices were returned as strings from PostgreSQL

### Changed

- **Settings page layout** - Moved version info, changelog, and GitHub links to sidebar under navigation

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Stock status false positives** - Fixed overly aggressive pre-order detection that incorrectly marked in-stock items as out of stock. Pages with "in stock", "add to cart", or "add to basket" text now correctly prioritize these indicators
- **Magento 2 stock detection** - Added proper stock status detection for Magento 2 sites, checking for stock classes and add-to-cart buttons

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Puppeteer fallback for JavaScript-rendered prices** - Automatically uses headless browser when no price found in static HTML, fixing extraction for Magento, React, Vue, and other JS-heavy sites
- **Pre-order/coming soon detection** - Products with future release dates, pre-order buttons, or "notify me" messaging are now correctly marked as out of stock
- **AI availability verification** - AI now checks if products are actually purchasable, not just if the price is correct
- **Official PriceGhost branding** - Custom ghost icon in navbar and login page
- **Ghostly text effect** - "Ghost" text in navbar has ethereal fade effect

### Fixed

- **Fresh install registration error** - Backend now creates all required database tables on startup, fixing 500 errors on fresh Docker installs without init.sql
- **Stock status for unreleased products** - Products showing "Coming Soon", "Available [future date]", or "Pre-order" are now correctly detected as out of stock

### Changed

- **CI/CD optimization** - Docker images only rebuild when relevant code changes (backend/** or frontend/**), not for README or documentation updates
