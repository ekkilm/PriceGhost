# PriceGhost

A self-hosted price tracking application that monitors product prices from any website. Get notified when prices drop, hit your target price, or items come back in stock.

## Built by AI. Built Right.

This entire application was developed collaboratively with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI assistant) using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). Every feature, from database migrations to responsive UI components, was crafted through iterative conversation and careful code generation.

**This is not "AI slop."** This is a fully functional, production-ready application with:
- Proper error handling throughout
- Clean, maintainable TypeScript codebase
- Real security practices (JWT auth, bcrypt hashing, input validation)
- Thoughtful UX with toast notifications, loading states, and responsive design
- Comprehensive API with consistent patterns

Built with Claude Opus 4.5.

## Strongly Recommended: Enable AI Extraction

While PriceGhost includes multiple scraping strategies (JSON-LD, meta tags, CSS selectors, pattern matching, and headless browser), **we highly recommend enabling AI-powered extraction** for the best results.

Modern e-commerce sites use increasingly complex layouts, dynamic pricing, and anti-scraping measures. AI extraction serves as an intelligent fallback that can understand page context and reliably extract prices even from difficult sites.

**To enable:**
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) (Claude) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Go to Settings > AI Extraction
3. Enable AI extraction and enter your key
4. That's it! AI will automatically kick in when standard scraping fails

The cost is minimal (fractions of a cent per extraction) and dramatically improves success rates.

### AI Extraction Setup (Highly Recommended)

For dramatically improved compatibility with difficult sites:

1. Go to Settings > AI Extraction
2. Enable AI-powered extraction
3. Choose your provider:
   - **Anthropic (Claude)** - Get key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

## Rate Limiting & Best Practices

To avoid getting blocked by retailers:

- **Staggered checking** - Products are checked at randomized intervals with ±5 minute jitter
- **Request delays** - 2-5 second random delay between checking different products
- **Reasonable intervals** - Default 1 hour; use longer intervals if tracking many products
- **Browser headers** - Requests use standard browser User-Agent strings
- **5-minute warning** - UI warns when selecting aggressive check intervals
